    Super Glitch Engine is being coded entirely from scratch,
and is intended as an homage to the Pokemon series, and more
specifically, the first generation of Pokemon games (Pokemon
Red, Blue, and Yellow). Super Glitch Engine is provided
entirely free of charge and without the intent of making money.
    Art and musical assets are taken from Pokemon Red, Blue,
and Yellow under what I believe to be Fair Use.

= Introduction</ br>
    Super Glitch Engine is an open source, cross-platform clone
of the Pokemon Red/Blue/Yellow games for Gameboy. It also
includes tools which allow the user to modify the game data.
Sprites, pokemon, maps, moves, and NPCs can all be modified to
make a new twist to the old Pokemon games or a completely
original game that stands on it's own. The only aspects of the
game that can't be changed without source editing are the basic
mechanics of moving in the overworld and fighting in turn-based
battles.

This part is pretty vague, but these are some of the milestones
I want to hit.
 - Overworld with multiple maps & dynamic loading
 - Complete battle system
 - Complex dialog options
 - Graphical splendor (Battle effects, overworld effects)
 - Basic scripting language for moves

The following are some very distant milestons I would like to
hit, but I'm still very far off from and can't confirm.
 - Online multiplayer functionality
    - Potentially in and out of battle
 - Full replica of Pokemon Yellow for an example
 - More advanced scripting language for glitching, etc

= FAQ</ br>
Q: What's up with the name "Super Glitch Engine?"</ br>
A: Well, there are a couple reasons why I named it that!
  (1) I thought it sounded cool (2) The engine is, at this
  time, pretty unstable (3) I want to eventually implement
  some of the various exploitable glitches into my demo and
  have a scripting language powerful enough for users to do the
  same without having to edit the code.

Q: Why would you want to add glitches into a game purposefully?</ br>
A: I feel like those exploitable glitches are so well known
  that they've become a part of the game experience for some
  people. If I can emulate a piece of that, I'll be getting
  closer to the experience of the actual game.

Q: Why wouldn't I just emulate Pokemon R/B/Y instead of using
  Super Glitch Engine?</ br>
A: If you want to play Pokemon on the computer or on a powerful
  enough mobile device and have no interest in modding it,
  emulation is still your best option. What Super Glitch Engine
  offers is the ability to tinker around with the various parts
  of these games.
  If I end up getting to it, SGE may be able to offer online
  multiplayer, which is something you can only sometimes get on
  emulator.
  I'm also planning on porting Super Glitch Engine to various
  devices that aren't powerful enough to run an emulator.

Q: Your code sucks! Are there no comments? Why did you do this
  this way? You should be ashamed/crucified!</ br>
A: Keep in mind that I am almost entirely self-taught. I know
  that's just a lame excuse, but it's true.
  I promise I will start commenting my code soon!

Q: Why did you code Super Glitch Engine in c? Why not Java, C#,
  C++, or any other language?</ br>
A: The biggest reason why I chose C is so that I could port the
  program over to integrated systems more easily. We'll see how
  that goes. I didn't code it in Java because generally
  speaking, systems that can run Java are well suited to run
  emulators as well.
