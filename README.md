#Super Glitch Engine Readme Document


###Introduction
Super Glitch Engine is an open source, cross-platform clone
of the Pokemon Red/Blue/Yellow games for Gameboy. It also
includes tools which allow the user to modify the game data.
Sprites, pokemon, maps, moves, and NPCs can all be modified to
make a new twist to the old Pokemon games or a completely
original game that stands on it's own. The only aspects of the
game that can't be changed without source editing are the basic
mechanics of moving in the overworld and fighting in turn-based
battles.


###Features
 - Overworld
     - NPC AI (Incomplete)
     - Tile mapping
 - Window system
     - Dialog with NPCs and in battle (Incomplete)
     - Menu (Incomplete)
     - Options
 - Battles
     - Battle menu (Incomplete)
     - Moves menu (Incomplete)
     - Typing
     - Wild battles (Incomplete)


###Todo
This part is pretty vague, but these are some of the milestones
I want to hit.

 - Complete battle system
 - Complex dialog options
 - Graphical splendor (Battle effects, overworld effects)
 - Basic scripting language for moves

The following are some very distant milestons I would like to
hit, but I'm still very far off from and can't confirm.

 - Online multiplayer functionality
    - Potentially in and out of battle
 - Full replica of Pokemon Yellow for an example
 - More advanced scripting language for glitching, etc
