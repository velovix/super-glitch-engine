#Super Glitch Engine Readme Document


###Introduction
Super Glitch Engine is an open source, cross-platform clone
of the Pokemon Red/Blue/Yellow games for Gameboy. It also
includes tools which allow the user to modify the game data.
Sprites, pokemon, maps, moves, and NPCs can all be modified to
make a new twist to the old Pokemon games or a completely
original game that stands on it's own. The only aspects of the
game that can't be changed without source editing are the basic
mechanics of moving in the overworld and fighting in turn-based
battles.


###Features
 - A nearly fully featured overworld that can be edited easily
 in the map editor
 - Interactable NPCs that you can talk to or battle
 - Menues that will soon be scriptable for easier access to
 features
 - Easy-to-use GUI editors for all finished parts of SGE!
 (Types, moves, and maps)
 - MUCH more to come


###Todo
Super Glitch Engine will have reached it's stable 1.0 phase
once the entirity of Pokemon Yellow could be created on it.
Anything that can't be done yet (and there's a lot) will be
added before the project is considered finished.

The following are some features I want to add that move beyond
the criteria I set for myself above.

 - Online multiplayer functionality
    - Potentially in and out of battle
 - Full replica of Pokemon Yellow for an example
 - More advanced scripting language for advanced events
 - Pokemon Gold/Silver features that can't be scripted in
